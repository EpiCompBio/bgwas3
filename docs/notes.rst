Cystic fibrosis
===============
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
======================
Often chronically infects patients with cystic fibrosis.

Mucoid morphotype
-----------------
Over-expression of alginate (thick viscous shite).

Metabolic profiling with nuclear magnetic resonance
---------------------------------------------------

Importants of metabolomics
==========================
@l
Limited to small molecules.
Genuinely untargeted/ unbiased for molecules above a threshold concentration.
Precise (can detect small differences).


From @behrend2013:

   ... genomic or transcriptomic studies cannot usually be transparently interpreted to understand the functional changes that result from adaptation, and additional methods are needed to study metabolism directly.
   Metabolic proﬁling approaches (metabolomics) have proven their usefulness in the context of functional genomics and hypothesis generation (Raamsdonk et al.
   , 2001; Allen et al., 2003; Nicholson and Lindon, 2008).
   They offer complementary information to transcriptomics and proteomics, in particular integrating the information downstream of the genome taking into account all layers of biological regulation, thus giving a ‘snapshot’ of the physiological state of a cell or organism (Oliver et al., 1998; Raamsdonk et al., 2001; ter Kuile and Westerhoff, 2001).

Methods of post-mapping (pathway) analysis
===========================================
Enrichment analysis
-------------------

http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp

   Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a computational method that determines whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states (e.g. phenotypes). 


- Compare genes to their PseudoCap function
 
 - eg Count the number of times a significant kmer is assocaited with a pathway.
