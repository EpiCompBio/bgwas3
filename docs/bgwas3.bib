	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The quality of automated gene prediction in microbial organisms has improved steadily over the past decade, but there is still room for improvement. Increasing the number of correct identifications, both of genes and of the translation initiation sites for each gene, and reducing the overall number of false positives, are all desirable goals.
RESULTS: With our years of experience in manually curating genomes for the Joint Genome Institute, we developed a new gene prediction algorithm called Prodigal (PROkaryotic DYnamic programming Gene-finding ALgorithm). With Prodigal, we focused specifically on the three goals of improved gene structure prediction, improved translation initiation site recognition, and reduced false positives. We compared the results of Prodigal to existing gene-finding methods to demonstrate that it met each of these objectives.
CONCLUSION: We built a fast, lightweight, open source gene prediction program called Prodigal http://compbio.ornl.gov/prodigal/. Prodigal achieved good results compared to existing methods, and we believe it will be a valuable asset to automated microbial annotation pipelines.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btt020},
	abstract = {SUMMARY: Counting all the k-mers (substrings of length k) in DNA/RNA sequencing reads is the preliminary step of many bioinformatics applications. However, state of the art k-mer counting methods require that a large data structure resides in memory. Such structure typically grows with the number of distinct k-mers to count. We present a new streaming algorithm for k-mer counting, called DSK (disk streaming of k-mers), which only requires a fixed user-defined amount of memory and disk space. This approach realizes a memory, time and disk trade-off. The multi-set of all k-mers present in the reads is partitioned, and partitions are saved to disk. Then, each partition is separately loaded in memory in a temporary hash table. The k-mer counts are returned by traversing each hash table. Low-abundance k-mers are optionally filtered. DSK is the first approach that is able to count all the 27-mers of a human genome dataset using only 4.0 GB of memory and moderate disk space (160 GB), in 17.9 h. DSK can replace a popular k-mer counting software (Jellyfish) on small-memory servers.

	abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive disease in infants, especially in low-income settings. Asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for disease, but variability in its duration is currently only understood at the serotype level. Here we developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data, and combined these results with whole genome sequence data. We estimated that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63\% of the phenotype variation, whereas the host traits considered here (age and previous carriage) accounted for less than 5\%. We further partitioned this heritability into both lineage and locus effects, and quantified the amount attributable to the largest sources of variation in carriage duration: serotype (17\%), drug-resistance (9\%) and other significant locus effects (7\%). A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration independent of serotype, potentially by disruption of the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance.},
