# Abstract {-}

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are now applied more often to microbes.
However, bacteria genomes are significantly more variable in both content and sequence than eukaryotic genomes,
meaning these association studies have naturally differnt, more complex considerations.
These studies utilise short unique DNA patterns, 
reffered to as Kmers,
as units of genetic variation 
as apposed to single nucleotide polymorphisms.
Various software solutions are now available 
which can pefoerm the multiple assocation tests of kmers,
notable the python based *pyseer*.
However, there is not at present a succint tool
which pipelines the necessary pre and post data processing and analysis steps
such as associating the Kmers to genes,
that make an association study whole.

In metabolomic studies of bacteria
there are thousands of possible measures that can be made
which can be considered as traits of that bacteria at a that point in time.
Coupling genomics and metabolomics may provide a powerful technque to understanding how a bacteria has adapted,
and in the scope of disease,
may aid in the understanding of the function of drug resistance and other virulence features.
However conducting indivudal assocation tests for each trait may prove time and computationally intesnsve.

I developed a tool, *bgwas2*,
which wraps the Kmer association function of *pyseer*
with other open source software tools
into a single installable package.
When run, *bgwas3* takes the simplest of input files
and a configuration file,
and peforms gene annotation, phylogeny estimation, kmer association testing, kmer-gene mapping and finally visualisation with a automatically generated web report.

In creating the tool, best practices for computational biology where excercised; resulting in a final tool that expresses approprate testing, documentation and packaging; meaning it can easily be utilised by other in the future.
CGAT-core is implemented in Python 3 and installable via Conda and PyPI with minimal dependencies. We have successfully deployed and tested the code on OSX, Red Hat and Ubuntu. We have made CGAT-core and associated repositories open-source under the MIT licence, allowing full and free use for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. Our software is fully documented (https://pypi.org), version controlled and has extensive testing using continuous integration (https://travis-ci. org/cgat-developers.) We welcome community participation in code development and issue reporting through GitHub

The tool was also used to test the assocation of 26 traits 
- 18 relatiing correspjoning to a metabolomic measurement,
and 8 corresponding to either a measure of to antibiotic resistance or bacterial motility.
In 14 of the traits, between 1 and 16450 significant Kmers were found, and were mapped to Genes.

# Introduction
## Pangenome wide association studies

Genome wide association studies have been successfuly used to identify genetetic and phenotype assocations in a hypthoses free manner.
Characteristics of microbes suggest they would be ideasl candidates for GWAS:
their genomes are small which limits the study size; they exude much less phenotypic flexibility; and, generally, phenotypes that are of interest such as virulence ans drug resisistance tend to be the result of strong selective pressures.
There is also good reason to peform assocation studies with bacteria.
as identifying the genetic basis of traits that correspond with its pathogenetic ability
could lead to better understanding of disease
an lead to new targets for pharmaceutical intervention

Commonly, GWAS have focued on single nucelotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as units of genetic variation.
SNPs are useful in organsims where recombination is reliable and genomes are relatively consistant among populations.
Because of linkage disequilibrium, identigying a highly associated SNP often means that the true associated loci is nearby

However, the nature of bacteria replication makes the use of SNPs in association studies less useful.
For one, significat regions of the geneome can be in linkage disequilibrium;
and though some species experience high rates of recombination, the recombination is not as reliable or consistent as in eukaryotes to reliably reduce linkage.

Secondly, bacteria experince much higher trans? during recombination. 
Therfore, bacteria of the same species? can vary consideriably in both order of gene content, and in the accessory genome - regions of the geneome which differ.

Therfore, first finding SNPs becomes a tricky process which involves multiple alignments. Such tools such as mummer (and other?) do meet this problem, but even still, SNPs assocated with ony the core genome can be retrieved
and does not consider the huge variable accessory genome in bacteria/ will not encapsulate the ful0

As an alternative, some recent studies have instead utlised K-mers.

Kmers are simply variable length sequences of DNA
Initially a concept of genome assembly
Can caputre multiple geneetic variations 
SNPs, 
longer deletions/ insertions 
and recombination 
The size of kmers effects the genetic variation captured
Longer more specificS
Shorter are more sensitive

Getting kmers is alignment freee, releasignt he burden of ultie alighnemt
But more specifically utilisng kmers means the core ans accesory geneome can be tested.

## The Need for Multiple Assocation Tests - Metabolomics

Metabolomics provides a detailed snapshot of an organismâ€™s physiological state through the quantification of hundreds to thousands of small molecules (Zampieri et al., 2017). 

Coupling genomics and metabolomics to study Pseudomonas aeruginosa in unique clinical samples can allow us to understand how bacteria adapt to the lung environment.

The nature of metabolimics measn that multiple molecules abundance may be measured and of interest to investigate.

## Scope of work

The foundation of this project was to create a tool, *bgwas3*,
an integration of mutltiple open source genomics tools 
and custom scripts written in python, R and bash
into a single installable package 
that facilitates conducting multiple pangenome wide association studies
in a single user step.

The tool aims to be comprehensive and robust enough to convert only the most basic required input files 
into valuable and interpretable results 
including static and interactive visualisations.

When run on a node within a computer cluster, 
tasks that are computationaly intensive or long 
are distrubuted among the cluster,
and can run simultaneuously.

Though the additional confugiureation file, the specifics of multile intermiedary steps can be altered, which can have variable effects on the final results.

In light of the necessity to peform multpple.. (\ref{fig:pipe})

## Pipelining with CGAT-Core

I wrote *bgwas3* primarily in python, utilising the piplining framework CGATCore, [@cribbs_cgat-core:_2019].
CGATCore is extremeley portable package coming as a dependency free Python package, but has been used to custruct many complex pipelines that are scalable to large amounts of data ?ref

With the framework, individual pipelining steps, 
referred to as 'tasks',
are defined as python functions 
whose arguments include the necessary input files 
and the expected output files.

With the use of python decoraters, the output files of one task can be used as the input arguments of later tasks.
This allows multiple data anlysis to be strung together and run in the correct order.
The framework utilises a system of checking the modifcation date of files,
so only runs tasks in which their are either new input files, or input files have been modified.
This checking system means a directory of project files may be moved from one location to another, even between computer,s
and the framework will still recognise which tasks and steps are out of date.

CGATCore introduces another significant feature which is an interface to control a distributed resource management management application API (DRMAA) such as PBS-Pro used by Imperial College Londons resource computing service.
Therefore, tasks which are deemed large are need to be run at batch, parallel processes can be distributed to computers in a cluster, and the system resource (eg RAM) can be set on a per task-basis.
This makes executing pipeline that involve cimputationally intesive intermediary steps faster.

*bgwas3* was written as 18 'tasks' which are visualised in \ref{fig:pipe}.

The 


## Genome Annotation

In the *bgwas* task "annotatate" all sample sequences are annotated by Prokka [@seemann_prokka:_2014]
The tool functions as follows:
It first makes predictions on features using a number of external tools including Prodigal [@] for the anotation of coding region, RNAmmer for ribosomal RNA genes, Aragorn for transfer RNA genes, SignalP for signal leader peptides and Infernal for non-coding RNA.
After feature prediction, the speculative features are queryed against a umber of databes suchs as UniProt [@], Refseq [@] and Pfam.

The function of annotating input sequences in the *bgwas3* pipeline is twofold. 
First, gene annotations are later used to estimate the phylogenetic tree of the sample,
and secondly, significantly associated Kmers are later mapped to the annatated genomes when identifying the Kmer's genetic identity.

## Kmer minig and counting

*bgwas3* integrates the tool fsm-lite [@valimaki_fsm-lite_2018] to count 'mine' and count Kmers. of user defined variable length kmers in the all samples.
fsm-lite benefits first by being able to run on a single core, but also because of its ability to read and count Kmers not of a single length, but of a range of lengths, unlike similar tools such as DSK?
As mentioned before, the length of Kmers effects the specificuty and ? of the association testing.
Therefore *bgwas3* allows the Kmers length to be changed by editing the configuration yml file ?

## Phylogeny estimation and covariate estimation

*bgwas3* currently takes a pangenomic approach to phylogeny estimation; as in it consideres the relative prescence and absence of genes in the samples as 
An estimated phylogenetic tree is estimated with *bgwas3* primariy utilisng the tool Roary [@page_roary:_2015].
In summary, Roary determnes genes which fall within the coregeneome, and then peforms clustering of isolates are clustered based on gene presence in the accessory genome.
An newick tree output of roary, is then converted into a distance matrix using a pythons script from pyseer.

The single reasoning for prediciting phylogeny in the *bgwas3* pipeine is to use the distances defined in the distance matrix as covariates int the assocation testing.

This is different to the standard method of multi-dimensional scaling often used in human gwas and as part of the standard seer workflow.
In general, if a phylogeny is accurate, th


## Kmer association testing

For linear mixed model assocation testing, a bgwas3 constructs a distance matrix based on a phylogenetic tree.
Assocation between kmers and phenotypes is implemented with pyseer [@lees_pyseer:_2018].

Specificially, pyseer is used to peform a linear mixed model using the Fast-LMM algorithm [@lippert_fast_2011].

LMM tackle confounders in association tests by using a measure of similarity (in this case a distance defined from a estimated phylogenetic tree) as a random effect in a linear model.

TODO equation

Given a means of determining the hierarchichal relatedness between samples, the mixed model is generally preffered, and has been shown in past studies to control the inflation of p-values better [@lees_genome-wide_2017].

## Bonferoni correction

The output of pyseer, a list of all kmers and statistics relating to their association to the given phenotype, are then filtered by their p-value though bonferoni correction.
The Bonferroni correction is a multiple-comparison correction used when several dependent or independent statistical tests, utilised to limit the number of spurious positive tests.
f multiple hypotheses are tested, the chance of a rare event increases, and therefore, the likelihood of incorrectly rejecting a null hypothesis (i.e., making a Type I error) increases
An R script **bonf.R** calculates a threshold p-value of which to accept an assocated kmer as significant based on its p-value


## Significant Kmer mapping

```{r,, fig.cap="\\label{fig:make_kmers}Graphical representation of algorithm to map Kmers to reference genes"}
knitr::include_graphics("_static/map_kmers.png");
```

A new script, written in R **map_kmers.R**, and which calls on the external tools BWA-Mem [@] and Bedtools [@] attempts to assign each associated kmer to a gene found in either a supplied reference genome, or one of the sample geneomes which has previously been annotated.

## Visualisation

An important feature of *bgwas3* is the automated generation of multiple figures, integrated into a final wbe based report.

## Scienitif computing practices

A significant goal of bgwas3 was to implement a useful and resuable tool that may be used outside the scope of this singlular project.

As such, various software development principles and concepts were applied to the project.

When assocation testing a qualitatitve variable with linear regression, it is generally assumed that the variable follows a normal distrubution.
Non-normal variables may fail to control for type-1 errors.

Quantitative (continuous) traits are preferred because they contain more information. 
the linear regression analysis requires all variables to be multivariate normal. 

A popular statistical technique to bring normality to a continuous trait in association studies involves peforming log transformation, or a rank based normal transformation. 

Prior to running *bgwas*, the n phenotypes were seperateley log transformed and INT, essesintially trippling the number of phenotypes tested.
